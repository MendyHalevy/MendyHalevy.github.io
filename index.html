        <p>You will also need a 6-8 quart crockpot.<p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large slow cooker (the larger the better!), place the potatoes in a single layer on the bottom of the cooking vessel..
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sprinkle the onions over the potatoes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place the beef in a single layer on top of the onions and potatoes. Place the two marrow bones in the meat. If you're adding a kishke, now would be the time to put it in the cooker.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Rinse the beans clean, checking for any stones or impurities. If using barley or kasha, do the same with the grains. Sprinkle the beans (raw or pre-soaked) and optional grains over the top of the meat. Place the three whole garlic cloves into the meat, evenly spaced. Sprinkle the whole mixture with the black pepper.</p> 
        
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> If using eggs, rinse them well and then tuck them into the meat. In a 4-cup container, whisk together the low sodium chicken broth, salt, paprika, turmeric, cumin and cayenne.
</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Pour the liquid over the cholent. Add additional water until all of the beans and pieces of meat are covered. For us, it's usually another 1-2 cups of water in our slow cooker-- it will vary; I usually add a bit more liquid if using grains, because they will soak it up.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Cover the slow cooker. Cook on low heat for 16 hours. Check occasionally as it's cooking; add additional water and stir a bit if  (unless it is the day of Shabbos). Most cookers will auto-switch to warm when the cooking is complete. If yours doesn’t, set it to warm until ready to serve.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> It will look a bit medieval when it's done cooking! Don't worry, just dig in and you'll see that it's perfectly cooked below the surface. Peel the eggs before serving the cholent.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rinse the chicken and place it in a tall stockpot. Cover the chicken with water, reserving about 3 inches of space at the top of the pot. Bring to a slow boil over medium high heat. As the chicken cooks, a fatty foam will start to rise. Skim this foam from the surface.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add celery, carrots, onion, zucchini, cilantro, parsley, and any other vegetable you find fitting to the pot. Add 1 tbsp of salt. Cover pot, reduce heat to medium, and allow pot to simmer for two hours.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the soup has simmered, allow it to cool for about 30 minutes. Pull meat from the chicken in bite-sized pieces and return to the broth. You may do the same to any other vegetable that's too big, then return the soup to a slow boil. Taste the broth. Add more salt, if desired– be sure to add slowly, don’t over-salt!</p>

    </table>
    
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. If you have time, let the salmon come to room temperature, it will cook faster and more evenly that way (but don't stress, when I'm in a hurry I do it straight from the fridge). The salmon fillets should be generously seasoned with salt and pepper. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place skillet over medium high heat for 3-4 minutes till drops of water sizzle and bead on the surface when you sprinkle them. When water dries pour 2 tbsp olive oil and swirl around the bottom of the pan to evenly coat. Oil will begin to smoke lightly after a moment or two.</p>
    
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place salmon fillets gently into the skillet, up to 4 at a time (depending on the size of your skillet), making sure not to crowd the pan. The fillets should not touch. If using skin-on fillets, the skin side should be facing upward, with meat against the pan.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Turn the burner up to high heat. Let the salmon sear for 2-3 minutes till a golden brown crust begins to form on the bottom edge of the meat. You'll be able to see the crust starting at the edge where the meat touches the pan. Once you see that, there is no need to lift the salmon and check-- the crust will continue developing in the oven. The less you disturb the salmon during cooking, the better.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> At this point, do not turn the salmon. Instead, transfer the whole skillet to the preheated oven. Let the salmon continue roasting in the oven for another 6-10 minutes. How long it cooks will depend on the thickness of the fillets and desired doneness-- some people like salmon a little on the rare side. Others like it fully cooked and flaking. For a fillet that is 1-inch thick at its thickest point, this usually takes around 7-8 minutes in the oven. Once cooked you can cut into the thickest part of a fillet with a sharp knife to make sure it's done to your liking.
When the salmon is done roasting, use an oven mitt to carefully remove the skillet from the oven. I do mean carefully, the skillet will be hot and the oil will be sizzling!</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Remove the fillets from the pan carefully with tongs or a fish spatula, plate them crust-side up, and serve. Keep in mind that if you keep them in the hot skillet they will continue to cook. These are especially nice with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Enjoy!</p>
